# Maze game

## Project overview
*Built from a course I took.*
In this game, you direct a ball through a maze to the endpoint. On every reload the maze builds itself in a random design, so that no two mazes are the same. Constructed with HTML, css, vanilla javascript and the [matter.js](https://brm.io/matter-js/) physics library.

*Only playable on desktop*

## Game controls
w-a-s-d or arrows to move ball. Refesh browser tab for new maze.
